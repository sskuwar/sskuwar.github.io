### Philosophy

“When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.”- Steve Job's father.

  * Abstract
  * Helicoverpa armigera is polyphagous and devastating insect pest of economic importance. Larval growth on various diets was compared by taking weights. Fecundity of moth is studied. Maximum larval and pupal weight was studied. Amylase activities were detected in all the larval instars, and various diets. Initial instars had lower amylase activity which steadily increased up to the sixth larval instar. Difference in the quantities of amylase in midguts of H. armigera on feeding natural and artificial diets was evident. Legumes, vegetables, flowers and cereal categories were studied by taking representative of each category. Amylase activity and isoform patterns varied on host plant and artificial diet. Artificial diet fed H. armigera larvae had comparatively high amylase activity and several unique amylase isoforms. By studying variation in amylase activity we came to know H. armigera regulates the levels of digestive enzymes in response to macromolecular composition of the diet. These adjustments in the digestive enzymes of H. armigera may be to obtain better nourishment from the diet and avoid toxicity. Study of crude sorghum inhibitor was also studied against amylase. We are also going to study the expression of amylase in various instar and various diets.

* Bachelor's degree project student at the Department of microbiology, University of Pune, Pune, India.

  * Abstract:
  * Chitin is the second number of abundant polysaccharide in the world. To utilize this abundant source of macromolecules it need to be degraded in to its monomer. For the degradation of chitin chitinase from bacillus will be a good candidate to utilize. In this project I have screened the chitinase producing bacilli and use it for production of chitin in flask level and visualize the degradation of chitin in to its monomer using thin layer chromatography and enzyme assay.
