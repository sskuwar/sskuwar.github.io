I have experience in the field of insect physiology, plant insect interactions, Bioinformatics, genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. I hold a PhD in Molecular Biology from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany and an MS in Biotechnology from the Institute of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at the University of Pune in Pune, India.

<b> <p>  Philosophy </b> <p>

<p> “When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.”- Steve Job’s father.<p>
